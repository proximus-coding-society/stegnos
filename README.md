This app will do something Awesome!

### add as project in NetBeans 8.2+ to run and work on

-> crypto graphy working

-> steganography working

Hide your secret message in a picture. We provide you even more security as your message will first be encrypted using a highly secure encryption algorithm and then will be stored into the image.

# So, What is CRYPTOGRAPHY & STEGNOGRAPHY ???

## **CRYPTOGRAPHY:-**
Encryption is a fundamental tool for the protection of sensitive information. Its historical purpose is privacy (preventing disclosure or confidentiality in communications. Encryption is a way of talking to someone while other people are listening, but such that the other people cannot understand what you are saying. It can also be used to protect data in storage as well as to detect active attacks, such as message or file modification.We refer to encryption as a tool because it is a means for achieving an end; it is not an end in itself. Cryptography, hidden writing, is a method for transforming the representation (appearance) of information without changing its information content. Plaintext (cleartext) is one representation of the information expressed in natural language, intelligible to all. Ciphertext is a different representation, designed to conceal the information from unauthorized persons. Encryption (or encipherment) is the transformation from cleartext to ciphertext. Decryption (or decipherment) is the reverse transformation.

History. Since the time of Julius Caesar and even before, people have protected the privacy of their communications by cryptography. Things are still that way, and yet everything is quite different. People continue to use cryptography, though far more sophisticated than Caesar’s, to protect their vital information as it passes through possibly hostile environments. Rather than crossing a few hills on its way to Rome, their
data is moving from one point in the space-time continuum to another. Messages and documents created at one place are delivered at a later time at some distant place. When transmission of messages and documents is by electronic means, delivery is at essentially the same time but at a different place. A file created on a computer can be recovered at
the same place but at a later time or, if it is copied onto a diskette, at some other place and at some later time. 
Historically, cryptography has been used chiefly in communications. Its application in data retrieval is a far more recent occurrence. The physical security and/or the access control mechanisms, whether they are on communications links, on network nodes and switches, on mainframes, file servers, and PCs, or on diskettes in transit, may not be sufficient to assure the confidentiality and the integrity of the data that passes through them. Cryptographic mechanisms are available that go far in establishing assurance in all these environments. The word cryptography and the associated word cryptology have very similar etymological origins. They are derived from the Greek words kriptos, which means “hidden”; graphos, which translates to “writing”; and 352 Information Security logos, which is “word” or “speech.” In current usage, however, they have slightly different meanings. Cryptography is the science of hiding information.

Decryption or decipherment is the inverse process of returning it to its original form. Any other, unauthorized method of recovering the original message is known as cryptanalysis or “breaking” the message. Cryptanalysis is the combination of science, art, and luck used to break messages or entire systems. The word cryptology nowadays refers to the study of both cryptography and cryptanalysis.

Their are many Types of famous encryption algorithm exist. Some of them are listed below:-

- SHA512
- RIPEMD
- TripleDES
- RSA
- MD5
- SHA256
- Blowfish
- AES

A software called as HASH Calc gives the idea about some of these Encryption Techniques:-

So we can see that the String "Hello World" after encryption in different techniques what it look likes. More the number of character in encryption, more strong is the encryption to decode.
 
 
## **STEAGANOGRAPHY:-**

Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. The word steganography combines the Greek words steganos (στεγανός), meaning "covered, concealed, or protected," and graphein (γράφειν) meaning "writing".
The first recorded use of the term was in 1499 by Johannes Trithemius in his Steganographia, a treatise on cryptography and steganography, disguised as a book on magic. Generally, the hidden messages appear to be (or be part of) something else: images, articles, shopping lists, or some other cover text. For example, the hidden message may be in invisible ink between the visible lines of a private letter. Some implementations of steganography that lack a shared secret are forms of security through obscurity, and key-dependent steganographic schemes adhere to Kerckhoffs's principle.
The advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret message does not attract attention to itself as an object of scrutiny. Plainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable they are, arouse interest and may in themselves be incriminating in countries in which encryption is illegal.

Whereas cryptography is the practice of protecting the contents of a message alone, steganography is concerned with concealing the fact that a secret message is being sent as well as concealing the contents of the message.
Steganography includes the concealment of information within computer files. In digital steganography, electronic communications may include steganographic coding inside of a transport layer, such as a document file, image file, program or protocol. Media files are ideal for steganographic transmission because of their large size. For example, a sender might start with an innocuous image file and adjust the color of every hundredth pixel to correspond to a letter in the alphabet. The change is so subtle that someone who is not specifically looking for it is unlikely to notice the change.

### HISTORY:-
The first recorded uses of steganography can be traced back to 440 BC when Herodotus mentions two examples in his Histories. Histiaeus sent a message to his vassal, Aristagoras, by shaving the head of his most trusted servant, "marking" the message onto his scalp, then sending him on his way once his hair had regrown, with the instruction, “When thou art come to Miletus, bid Aristagoras shave thy head, and look thereon." Additionally, Demaratus sent a warning about a forthcoming attack to Greece by writing it directly on the wooden backing of a wax tablet before applying its beeswax surface. Wax tablets were in common use then as reusable writing surfaces, sometimes used for shorthand.

In his work Polygraphiae Johannes Trithemius developed his so-called "Ave-Maria-Cipher" that can hide information in a Latin praise of God. "Auctor Sapientissimus Conseruans Angelica Deferat Nobis Charitas Potentissimi Creatoris" for example contains the concealed word VICIPEDIA.

The above letter was written by famous body builder: Arnold Schwarzenegger to the STATE ASSEMBLY.
The Letter contains following hidden message:-
